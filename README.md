# Hi there, I'm Lívia Pimentel! 👋
  
🚀 **Professional Experience**  
I have a solid background in Machine Learning, specializing in developing models from experimentation to deployment, driving measurable impact.
Here are some highlights of my career:
- Spearheaded end-to-end machine learning projects in the energy pricing sector, from data collection to model deployment in the context of MLOps.
- Developed autopilot and image recognition systems for drones, showcasing innovative solutions in computer vision using synthetic datasets.
- Conducted research and applied machine learning models to detect intruder drones, presenting findings at the SIGE conference @ ITA ([Paper](https://www.sige.ita.br/edicoes-anteriores/2021/st/217759_1.pdf)).
- Currently delving into GenAI. Check my latest repos: [genai-foundations](https://github.com/LiviaPimentel/genai-foundations) and [autogen travelplanner](https://github.com/LiviaPimentel/autogen-travelplanner)

👩‍🏫 **Volunteer Work**
